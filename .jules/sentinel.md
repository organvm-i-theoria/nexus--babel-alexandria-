## 2024-10-26 - Initial Security Setup
**Vulnerability:** Absence of `.gitignore` in a new repository.
**Learning:** New repositories often lack basic security controls, leading to accidental commitment of secrets (API keys, env files) or build artifacts.
**Prevention:** Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` immediately upon initialization to block sensitive files before any development begins.
