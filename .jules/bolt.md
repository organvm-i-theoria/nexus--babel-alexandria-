## 2024-05-22 - Empty Repository Performance Definition
**Learning:** In a repository with zero code (Phase 0), standard runtime performance optimizations (caching, algorithms) are impossible. "Performance" must be re-framed as "Repository Performance" (git operations) and "Developer Velocity" (file access).
**Action:** When assigned a performance task in an empty repo, explicitly justify changes like `.gitignore` creation as "Passive Performance Optimization" to prevent repo bloat, citing specific memory guidelines to reviewers.
