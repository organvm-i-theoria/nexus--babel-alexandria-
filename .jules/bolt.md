## 2024-05-23 - [No Optimization Identified]
**Learning:** The repository is empty (Phase 0). There is no application code to optimize. Standard tooling setup (like `.gitignore` or `ruff`) is considered "configuration" or "new dependencies", not "runtime performance optimization".
**Action:** Aborted task to avoid creating unnecessary PRs or violating boundaries. Recorded this outcome for future reference.
