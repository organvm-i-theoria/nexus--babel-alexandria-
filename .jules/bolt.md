## 2024-05-23 - Premature Scaffolding vs Optimization
**Learning:** Creating new "optimized" scaffolding (like `HyperNode` with `__slots__`) when no code exists is considered scope creep and adding unused code, rather than a valid performance optimization.
**Action:** When the codebase is empty, focus on environment configuration (like `.gitignore`) or explicit foundational tasks if assigned, but do not frame feature creation as "performance optimization" of existing code.
