## 2024-05-22 - Standardizing Entry Points
**Learning:** In early-stage repositories (Phase 0), "UX" often means "Developer Experience" (DX). New contributors get lost without a clear entry point.
**Action:** Always ensure a root `README.md` exists that links to key documentation (like `DESIGN.md` and `roadmap.md`) before writing any code. Simplify complex filenames to make them CLI-friendly.
