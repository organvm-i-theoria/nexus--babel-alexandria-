## 2026-01-17 - Repository DX as UX
**Learning:** In codebases without a UI, "UX" extends to Developer Experience (DX), specifically file naming and entry points. Hostile filenames (special characters) and missing READMEs act as bad UX for contributors.
**Action:** When no frontend exists, prioritize sanitizing filenames and establishing standard documentation entry points to improve the repository's interface.
