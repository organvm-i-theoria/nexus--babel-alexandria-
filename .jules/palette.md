**Learning:** In a project with no code, the primary "UX" is Developer Experience (DX). Long, unwieldy filenames with special characters (like `#`) create friction for developers using the command line.
**Action:** When initializing a repo or documenting it, ensure filenames are short, semantic, and easy to type/tab-complete. Renaming `# Theoria...` to `DESIGN.md` significantly improves accessibility for developers.
