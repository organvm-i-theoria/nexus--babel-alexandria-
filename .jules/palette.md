## 2024-05-23 - Repository Structure as First UI
**Learning:** For a new project, the repository structure itself is the first user interface a developer encounters. Missing entry points (`README.md`) and poor file naming create immediate friction and cognitive load, discouraging contribution.
**Action:** Always ensure a clear `README.md` exists acting as a map, and use consistent, easy-to-type filenames for core documentation to improve Developer Experience (DX).
