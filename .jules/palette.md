## 2024-05-23 - [The Empty Repo UX]
**Learning:** When a repository is empty, the most critical "UX" improvement is a clear, inviting `README.md`. It acts as the landing page and navigation hub for developers.
**Action:** Always check for `README.md` first. If missing, create one that links to existing docs (like `DESIGN.md` or `roadmap.md`) to provide immediate context and wayfinding.
