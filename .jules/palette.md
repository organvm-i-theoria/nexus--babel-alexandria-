## 2024-05-22 - Standardizing Entry Points
**Learning:** In early-stage repositories, the absence of a standard `README.md` and clean filenames (like `DESIGN.md` instead of long, space-filled names) significantly hampers developer experience. These "invisible" UX elements are critical for onboarding and accessibility in terminal environments.
**Action:** Always prioritize standardizing entry points (README.md) and cleaning up filenames before adding feature code in new repositories.
