## 2026-01-20 - Filename Hygiene as Developer Accessibility
**Learning:** Complex filenames containing special characters (like `#`) and spaces significantly degrade developer experience (DX) by complicating terminal operations and autocomplete. This serves as an accessibility barrier for developers, particularly those using screen readers or relying on efficient CLI workflows.
**Action:** Prioritize sanitizing entry point filenames to standard conventions (e.g., `DESIGN.md` instead of verbose titles) to ensure the repository "interface" is intuitive and accessible.
