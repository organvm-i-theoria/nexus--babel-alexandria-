# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)

Welcome to the Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS) repository. This project aims to build a paradigm-shifting computational linguistics framework—a **Theoria Linguae Machina**—that replaces linear NLP pipelines with a dynamic, nine-layer plexus architecture.

## 📚 Documentation

- **[Design Document](DESIGN.md)**: Comprehensive architectural specifications, formal mathematical foundations (Category Theory, Hypergraphs), and detailed function references.
- **[Roadmap](roadmap.md)**: Exhaustive implementation plan, broken down into atomic tasks and phases.

## 🚀 Project Status

We are currently in **Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**.
The repository structure is being initialized.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

(Coming Soon - See [Roadmap Task 0.1.2](roadmap.md#012-development-tools-configuration))

Expected requirements:
- Python 3.11+
- Poetry
- Docker

## 🤝 Contributing

Please refer to the roadmap to see current priorities.
