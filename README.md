# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)

## 🎨 Overview

The Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS) is a paradigm-shifting computational linguistics framework—a **Theoria Linguae Machina** that embodies theoretical sophistication, practical implementation, and ethical governance.

This project implements a nine-layer plexus architecture with bidirectional information flow, replacing linear NLP pipelines with a dynamic network modeling genuine linguistic cognition.

## 📚 Key Documentation

*   **[Comprehensive Design Document](DESIGN.md)**: Detailed architectural specifications, formal mathematical foundations, and system design.
*   **[Implementation Roadmap](roadmap.md)**: Atomic-level task decomposition for implementing the system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

*Current Status: Phase 0 (Foundation & Infrastructure)*

Please refer to the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for the current implementation status and upcoming tasks.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

*   **Nine-Layer Stack**: From Iconographic/Interface to Meta-Interface.
*   **Bidirectional Flow**: Unified hypergraph substrate.
*   **Multimodal**: Text, speech, image, video, gesture, emoji.
*   **Multilingual**: Designed for 100+ languages.
*   **Dual-Mode Governance**: RAW (Research) and PUBLIC (Safety-Gated) modes.
