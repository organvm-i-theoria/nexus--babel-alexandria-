> "A paradigm-shifting computational linguistics framework."

## 🌟 Overview

The **Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)** is a comprehensive framework designed to model genuine linguistic cognition. It replaces linear NLP pipelines with a dynamic network of nine layers, from iconographic input to meta-interface output.

For a deep dive into the architecture, please consult the [Design Document](DESIGN.md).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

We are currently in **Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**.

See the [detailed roadmap](roadmap.md) for upcoming milestones, including:
- 🏗️ **Phase 0:** Foundation & Infrastructure
- 🕸️ **Phase 1:** Hypergraph Core
- 🗣️ **Phase 2:** Linguistic Analysis Core
