# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)

🎨 **Theoria Linguae Machina**

Welcome to the **Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)** repository. This project aims to build a paradigm-shifting computational linguistics framework that replaces linear NLP pipelines with a dynamic nine-layer plexus architecture.

## 🚧 Status: Phase 0 (Foundation)

We are currently in **Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**. The goal is to establish the development environment and core infrastructure.

- **Current Task:** ENV-001 (Initialize directory structure)
- **Next Steps:** Setting up dev tools and CI/CD pipelines.

## 📚 Documentation

For a deep dive into the architecture, theory, and roadmap, please refer to:

- [**Design Document**](DESIGN.md) - The comprehensive design document detailing the nine-layer plexus architecture, formal mathematical foundations, and semiotic engine.
- [**Roadmap**](roadmap.md) - The exhaustive implementation roadmap with atomic-level task decomposition.

## 🛠️ Contributing
