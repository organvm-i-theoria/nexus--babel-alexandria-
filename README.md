# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)

## Overview
The **Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)** is a comprehensive system designed to implement a unified representation system for linguistic and multimodal analysis. It aims to bridge the gap between computational linguistics, rhetorical theory, and semiotics through a novel hypergraph architecture.

This project is currently in **Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**.

## Documentation
- [Roadmap](roadmap.md): Detailed implementation plan and atomic task breakdown.
- [Design Document](DESIGN.md): Comprehensive theoretical and architectural specifications.

## Planned Project Structure
The repository is intended to be organized as follows (see Roadmap Phase 0.1.1):
- `/core`: Core hypergraph data structures and utilities.
- `/modules`: Linguistic processing modules (phonology, syntax, etc.).
- `/engines`: Higher-order rhetorical and semiotic engines.
- `/interfaces`: API and visualization interfaces.
- `/safety`: Safety gates and ethical constraints.
- `/meta`: Meta-learning and evolutionary components.
- `/data`: Data management and models.

## UX & Accessibility Vision
As we build the RLOS, we are committed to the following UX principles, even in our CLI and API interfaces:
- **Developer Experience (DX) is UX**: Clear documentation, intuitive error messages, and consistent API design are paramount.
- **Accessibility**: All visualization tools and web interfaces will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Invisibility**: Complex rhetorical analysis should be presented simply and intuitively.

## Getting Started
