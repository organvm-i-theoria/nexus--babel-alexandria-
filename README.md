# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)

The Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS) represents a paradigm-shifting computational linguistics framework—a **Theoria Linguae Machina** that embodies theoretical sophistication, practical implementation, and ethical governance.

## Documentation

*   **[Design Document](DESIGN.md)**: Comprehensive architectural specifications, formal mathematical foundations, and system design.
*   **[Roadmap](roadmap.md)**: Exhaustive implementation roadmap and task decomposition.

## Overview

RLOS replaces linear NLP pipelines with a dynamic nine-layer plexus architecture modeling genuine linguistic cognition. It integrates:
*   Category Theory functors
*   Synchronous Hyperedge Replacement Grammars
*   Peircean semiotics
*   Aristotelian rhetoric

## Status

**Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**

See `roadmap.md` for detailed task tracking.
