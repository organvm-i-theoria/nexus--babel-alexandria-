# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)

> **Theoria Linguae Machina**: A paradigm-shifting computational linguistics framework that embodies theoretical sophistication, practical implementation, and ethical governance.

## Overview

The RLOS is a nine-layer plexus architecture with bidirectional information flow, replacing linear NLP pipelines with a dynamic network modeling genuine linguistic cognition. It is designed to handle multimodal processing (text, speech, image, video, gesture, emoji) across 100+ languages.

## Project Status: Phase 0 (Foundation)

This repository is currently in **Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure**.
There are no stable releases yet.

## Key Documentation
