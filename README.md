# Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS) 🧠💬

> **Theoria Linguae Machina**: A comprehensive computational linguistics framework for the future of machine rhetoric and semiotics.

## 🌟 Overview

The **Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS)** represents a paradigm shift in computational linguistics. Unlike traditional pipelines, RLOS utilizes a **nine-layer plexus architecture** with bidirectional information flow to model genuine linguistic cognition.

From phonology to rhetoric, and from icons to discourse, RLOS is designed to understand and generate language with theoretical sophistication and ethical governance.

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the repository:

*   **[🎨 Design Document](DESIGN.md)**: The comprehensive theoretical and architectural specification ("Theoria Linguae Machina").
*   **[🗺️ Roadmap](roadmap.md)**: The atomic-level task decomposition for implementation.

## 🏗️ Project Status

**Current Phase:** `Phase 0: Foundation & Infrastructure`

We are currently in the early stages of establishing the development environment and core infrastructure.

*   **Goal:** Establish development environment and core infrastructure.
*   **Timeline:** Months 1-2.
