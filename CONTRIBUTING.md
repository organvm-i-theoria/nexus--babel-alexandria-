# Contributing to RLOS

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in contributing to the Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System.

## 🎨 Palette's Guide to Contributions

As we build this system, we ask all contributors to keep the user (and developer) experience in mind.

### 1. Accessibility First
- **Semantic HTML**: Use the right tag for the job.
- **ARIA Labels**: Ensure all interactive elements have accessible names.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Everything must be usable without a mouse.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure text is readable for everyone.

### 2. Code Quality
- **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint` before committing.
- **Testing**: Run `pnpm test` to ensure your changes don't break anything.
- **Formatting**: Keep code clean and consistent.

### 3. Small, Atomic Changes
- We prefer small, focused pull requests over massive overhauls.
- Describe *why* you are making a change, not just *what* you changed.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) to find open tasks.
Currently, we are in **Phase 0** (Foundation & Infrastructure).

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and inclusive in all interactions. We are building a system to understand language; let's use ours kindly.
