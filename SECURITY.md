We take the security of the Rhetorical-Linguistic Operating System (RLOS) seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Process

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please follow these steps:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed description of the vulnerability to [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL HERE].
2. **Details**: Include as much information as possible to help us reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept scripts, screenshots, affected versions).
3. **Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide regular updates on our progress.

### Scope

This policy applies to the main repository and all associated sub-modules.

### Safe Harbor

We pledge not to initiate legal action against researchers for penetrating our systems as long as they:
- Act in good faith to reduce harm to users.
- Do not access or modify user data without permission.
- Adhere to this policy.
